### ⚠️ Small Modification Required

To make this project work correctly, please make the following change:

> **In the `index.js` file**, update the `api_url` to:

```javascript
const api_url = "https://api.quotable.io/random";
```

This URL is used to fetch random quotes from the [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io/), which powers the quote generation feature in this project.
